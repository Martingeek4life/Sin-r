Approval of the Minutes 
Yesterday 's Minutes have been distributed . 
Are there any comments ? 
Mr President , I just wish to mention that my name does not appear in the attendance register in yesterday 's Minutes . 
This is probably my fault because I cannot remember whether I signed or not , but I was indeed present . 
Mr President , this is just to inform the House that I was here yesterday but was not recorded in the Minutes . 
I would be grateful if that could be changed . 
Very well . 
The necessary corrections will be made . 
Mr President , may I draw attention to the fact that yesterday one of our National Front colleagues was encouraging us to celebrate the 14th of July and to dance the carmagnole , while at the same time the mayor of Toulon was banning the festival arranged by the anti - racist organization SOS Racisme , on this French day of freedom ? 
This is clear evidence of double standards at Toulon and at Strasbourg . 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr FabreAubrespry 's intervention comes as no surprise , since he informed the Committee on Budgets yesterday evening that he would be making it . 
The text in question is an interinstitutional agreement concluded with the Council and the Commission in connection with the second pillar of the Maastricht Treaty and concerning the funding of foreign - policy measures . 
The document in its present wording has been on the table since the conclusion of the negotiations in Amsterdam . 
The fact that 4 July is the date given on the cover page is simply due to the document having become a report . 
The document , however , has been on the table since Amsterdam ; in other words , the countdown to the amendment deadline has been running since 30 June . 
We in the Committee on Budgets have arranged another extraordinary meeting of our own for this afternoon to discuss the details of this report , because a motion has been tabled for a decision to be taken without debate tomorrow on the basis of Rule 143 . 
I assume , Mr President , that this fulfils the formal requirements and would therefore ask you to reject Mr Fabre - Aubrespy 's request . 
Mr President , the Minutes do not record my presence yesterday . 
I would like that corrected . 
Thank you very much , Mrs Ahern . 
That has been noted . 
( The Minutes were approved ) 
Decision on urgency 
I call on Mr Colino Salamanca , the representative of the Committee on Agriculture , to speak on the basis of the item . 
Mr President , yesterday the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development decided to approve the urgent nature of the Commission 's proposal and to submit it to the part - session for consideration as part of Friday 's agenda , without a report . 
I would , however , request that Mr Funck , whom our committee has appointed to present a report , be allowed to give the House an informal oral report , under paragraph 5 of Rule 97 of the Rules of Procedure . 
( The request was approved ) 
Legal protection of biotechnological inventions 
The next item is the report ( A4 - 0222 / 97 ) by Mr Rothley , on behalf of the Committee on legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions ( COM ( 95 ) 066 . 
C4 - 0063 / 96 - 95 / 0350 ( COD ) ) . 
Mr President , a journalist from the Wall Street Journal recently asked me if I was a patent attorney . 
I told her I was not and that I had no particular interest in patents . 
But people with genetic diseases becoming curable does interest me , and people finding work interests me too ! 
And that Europe should not fall any further behind in biotechnology and genetic engineering , that interests me ! 
( Applause ) By adopting this Directive we are not opening any floodgates . 
We are meeting our obligations under the international convention , in which all Member States of the European Union and the Union itself have pledged themselves to grant patent protection for products and processes in all areas of technology . 
This patent legislation has been created in the United States and it has been created in Japan . 
It is only a matter of the European Union upgrading its patent law to this international standard . 
That is all . 
The European Patent Office does issue patents in this area . 
These patents , however , can be challenged by national courts , and there is therefore a real danger of legal fragmentation in Europe , a fragmentation that would be poison for investment in Europe . 
That is why we need this Directive . 
By the way , I said that this patent protection already exists in the United States and in Japan . 
I do not believe that the Americans or Japanese are morally corrupt . 
How absurdly presumptuous of us to think we are morally superior to the others ! 
It will no doubt be asserted in the course of this debate that this Directive will obstruct research . 
That , of course , is untrue . 
Patent protection is a prerequisite of research . 
How can any research be conducted at all if inventions are not made public ? 
We know from experience that effective patent protection and research go hand in hand . 
Or has research in the United States perhaps hit rock - bottom , or has research in Japan hit rock - bottom ? 
Nothing could be further from the truth ! 
If we do not create this patent protection , research will , of course , continue . 
But it will continue behind close doors . 
We shall not have the opportunity to follow and discuss the development of biotechnology and genetic engineering . 
We shall also , incidentally , destroy the small university research establishments and the small and medium - sized businesses that live from selling their patents to pharmaceutical companies . 
Those who want to do that should vote against the Directive ! 
But they should not subscribe to any more resolutions against unemployment . 
( Applause ) It is asserted that discoveries would be patented under the Directive . 
That , of course , is untrue . 
Nobody in the world who knows anything of patent law would make that claim , with the exception of Greenpeace 's legal experts . 
It is asserted that treatments will be patented in the future . 
That , of course , is untrue . 
Diagnostic and therapeutic processes will be no more eligible for patenting than they have been in the past . 
That is expressly stated in the recitals of this Directive . 
It is asserted that parts of the human body would be patented . 
That , of course , is untrue . 
We have made that crystal - clear in the text of this Directive . 
Parts of the human body will not be patented . 
What will be patented are products made by human hand and nothing else ! 
We have made that crystal - clear in Article 3 . 
Paragraph 1 describes what discoveries are , and paragraph 2 describes what inventions are . 
There are some forms of dyslexia for which I cannot be held responsible ! 
( Laughter ) The European Parliament has been under considerable pressure over the last few days , not only here in the House . 
The Protestant Church in Germany , my own church , allowed Greenpeace to stage a children 's crusade against this Directive at its General Assembly . 
( Heckling ) I assume that , for the youngsters who took part in it , this was the first time they had heard the word ' patent ' . 
Enough of this nonsense ! 
( Applause ) Let us have done with this nonsense and come back to the subject of patent law . 
This law will not be able to solve the ethical questions that arise in connection with biotechnology and genetic engineering . 
That is beyond the power of patent law ; it is a constant task of society and its legislatures . 
It cannot be done by patent law alone . 
Patent law seeks only to prohibit the unauthorized use of someone else 's invention for commercial purposes . 
That is all . 
It is , if you like , part of the law governing competition . 
And for that reason we need this Directive to strengthen competition within the European Union . 
We need it urgently . 
That is why I ask for your support . 
( Applause ) 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this is a serious matter . 
This is the first time in the history of humanity that patents are to be issued in respect of living material . 
And when Mr Rothley says it is a matter of protecting products made by human hand , we cannot fail to observe that what is to be made patentable today has indeed been produced by human hand . 
Generations of human hands , Mr Rothley , have contributed to a colossal cultivation effort to create what we live on today , the basis of our subsistence . 
And along come interested parties now and look at this creation , at the way in which the farming community has been able , as a matter of course , to develop and sow seed , to breed and rear animals and to feed us with the fruits of its labour , and these interested parties decide they would like a slice of the cake . 
They certainly do provide a genetic boost to the process of livestock development and land cultivation , but the purpose of this genetic boost , which they subsequently patent , is to give them rights over the entire stock of seed and animals . 
It is a question , Mr Rothley , of coining in on something that has always been a matter of course . 
That is what the Agriculture Committee wanted to prevent at all costs . 
We have emphasized the so - called farmer 's privilege . 
This is nothing more than the right of farmers to raise their livestock and to sow their seed . 
We were unable to have this view adopted in its entirety , but we did manage to enshrine something of this right . 
And , Mr Rothley , the Committee on Agriculture also called for removal from the draft Directive of the clause on reversal of the burden of proof . 
I ask the House to accept the proposal of the Agriculture Committee on this point too , so that those who wish to claim rights under a patent must prove that they are indeed the legitimate holders of the patent . 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy voted by a large majority in favour of the proposal for a directive that we are today debating , asking the Legal Affairs Committee to refine it further . 
I cannot but be in complete agreement with what Mr Rothley has said and want only to highlight a couple of points . There is substantial demand for the products of biotechnology : demand from citizens , particularly those whose circumstances are rather specia. and this mainly involves the pharmaceuticals sector ; and demand from sectors , such as agriculture , in which products of this kind could bring substantial benefits from many points of view . 
What we therefore need to determine is whether Europe , whether the European Union , wants merely to be a consumer and , therefore , importer of the results of research into biotechnology , via the products in which biotechnology has been used , or whether it wants also to be a producer and , consequently , a potential exporter . 
The protection of biotechnological inventions , which we also need to enable the single market to function better , is vital in order to provide a favourable framework for the development of European industry in the sector , with obvious advantages : for employment , as Mr Rothley has already said and I can only emphasize further ; for the development of research in a rapid growth sector ; to generate value added , income , well - being ; t. and I venture to stress thi. make it possible to retain greater control of the sector , particularly given the ethical and other concerns that many people have . But we shall be in no position whatsoever to express those concerns if we continue to be dependent on , and therefore marginal to , the industrial research and development work being done elsewhere in the world and primaril. as we have already been reminde. in the United States and Japan by European industries also . 
Mr President , about 40 % of today 's world economy is based on genetic resources from developing countries . 
These so - called developing countries also contain 86 % of the world 's plants . 
Every fourth medicinal drug is manufactured from the genetic resources of tropical plants . 
Eighty - three per cent of known genetic diversity and in situ knowledge is held in Africa , Asia and Latin America . 
The German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation writes that , according to estimates by the International Ethnobotanical Society , the indigenous peoples in those three parts of the world possess 99 % of the entire body of knowledge on useful biological diversity . 
In other words , this means that the bulk of the resources we are now discussing , resources for biotechnological inventions and for patents awarded or potentially awardable in respect of such inventions , come from the Third World . 
These biological resources are too often used without the consent , or indeed against the wishes , of the indigenous peoples or local communities in whose country they are found ; we might even say they are being stolen . 
The use of these resources for biotechnological inventions depends on traditional wisdom , such as knowledge of their medicinal properties or cultivation methods . 
This means that the multinationals make huge profits from the biodiversity of developing countries and from the traditional knowledge of their inhabitants without a decision - making process , without consent , without legal protection and participatory rights for the populations concerned and that they even patent human or biological material . 
The best - known examples are perhaps the Guayami Indians in Panama and the Hagahai in Papua - New Guinea or on the Solomon Islands . 
That is why it is especially important to strengthen intellectual and cultural property rights in the countries of the Third World and particularly among indigenous peoples . 
When Mr Rothley says jobs are at stake , that is nothing but polemics . 
Multinational corporations are acquiring the property rights of the world 's population . 
So what we actually need is a convention on traditional rights . 
That is why our committee has rejected this report . 
We have agreed with Mr Rothley on the inclusion of the principles enshrined in Article 8j of the Convention on Biological Diversity . 
The committee will have a free vote . 
If the recital based on this Article is accepted , the position will have changed . 
As someone involved in Third World policy , I can say from personal experience that no jobs are created by these activities ; they only serve to swell the coffers of the multinationals . 
The current system under the European Patent Convention is better . 
The harmonization envisaged in the new Directive will bring us no nearer to a common convention for the people of this world . 
Mr President , the opinion of the Environment Committee seeks to restrain Mr Rothley 's report . 
When ordinary people hear that we are debating patents on genes , the immediate reaction is everywhere the same : you cannot take out a patent on that kind of thing , regardless of the fact that a substance can be patented if it is possible to characterize it by its structure . 
This instinctive repugnance is something we should take seriously . We should at least make the patentability of genes as restrictive as possible , so that the patent only covers the industrial application for which it has been sought . 
We should also do that for the sake of the patients . 
Patients suffering from rare diseases or cancer , for which knowledge on a great variety of genes is needed , are gravely concerned that it may not otherwise be possible to pay for the research . 
However , it should not be possible to patent methods of diagnosis . 
Official circles in Denmark have been particularly concerned to ensure that it is not possible to patent procedures for the modification of the genetic identity of human body cells . 
This would , for example , make it impossible to take out patents on cosmetic interventions in human beings . 
I therefore urge you to vote for my amendment to paragraph 2a of Article . not paragraph 2b , as has been incorrectly indicated . 
The amendment excludes the possibility of such a patent . 
Finally measures should be taken to ensure that , in accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity , agreement has been reached on the equitable sharing of economic benefits before a patent is issued in those cases in which biological material is obtained from a developing country . 
In my Amendment No 65 I am asking , for reasons I do not have time to explain here because unfortunately so very little speaking time has been allowed , that the sentence on publication be dropped . 
I have just three observations , since I have three minutes . 
The first thing I want to say is that the draft directive that has been put before us answers the main objections that had led to the first draft being rejected , as you will recall , in March 1995 : the ban on germ - line therapy , the protection of animal rights , the setting up of an ethics committee and , most importantly , the clear commitment to a ban on patenting the human body ; and on this point I believe that the wording our committee has come up with , which eliminates the ambiguities in the Commission 's initial draft , could not be clearer . 
My second observation concerns the slogan ' No patents on life ' , a slogan with which we have been bombarded at enormous expenditure of resources , which I cannot help wondering about , in a flood of letters , cards and press releases , of which we have all been a target . 
As if the directive 's opponents had a monopoly on protecting life and its supporters were messengers of death ! 
Let me say quite emphatically that , for me , protecting life means not standing in the way of progress in medical research . 
Protecting life means giving hope to children suffering from cystic fibrosis . 
Protecting life means opening up new prospects in the fight against malaria . 
Protecting life , when all is said and done , means stamping out hunger in the world by increasing the available food resources . 
Protecting life means finding new types of crops that are more economical with our soils and require fewer fertilizers and pesticides . 
The so - called cautious approach that some people advocate is a luxury that only well - off westerners can afford ! 
My third and final observation . 
I should like to say a word on exceptions to patentability , which has to do with methods of intervention on embryos . 
Let us be clear on this point : there was never any question of patenting the embryo , any more than the human body or its parts . 
Certainly not . 
However , this measure does cause problems , let it be said , between the PPE and ourselves . 
It is a measure that springs from an initiative of one of our PPE colleagues and which , because it involves public order and moral standards , does affect , let 's face it , not just patentability , but also research . 
As we know , research on embryos is banned in Germany , and I respect this decision , I respect the conviction behind it , but this very same research is authorized , and strictly controlled by legislative provisions and codes of practice , in the United Kingdom , Spain , Belgium and France . 
It is necessary not only to make progres. it has been done in fields such as in vitro fertilizatio. but also to open up new prospects in the fight against nervous disorders , or against Alzheimer 's disease . 
Ladies and gentlemen , you will understand that my group cannot accept the ban imposed by this paragraph . 
We respect your convictions , which derive from your history , your culture and your religion . 
I am asking you to respect ours too . 
I have to tell you that we shall be voting against this paragraph . 
But we shall of course be voting in favour of the Rothley report . 
Mr President , I believe that the anguish that has surrounded this directive is justified . It is justified because what this directive is doing is statutorily regulating the activity of man who having first observed and laid hands on innermost matter , the atom , is now observing and laying hands on the most intimate aspects of living matter . 
There are problems , and they are by no means trivial . 
The task is made all the more difficult because this is a field that is difficult to understand , in both legal and biological terms . 
Patent law is a difficult area , this is a new field and biology is hard to explain to those unfamiliar with the subject . 
Finally , there is a great deal of pressure from European pharmaceutical industries that want to be able to compete with the United States and Japan : they hold out the prospect of more jobs , but they need to make huge investments because , these days , inventions are not the product of a stroke of genius but the result of an effort over a long period by many people . 
Moreover , cultural circles and environmentalists are bring pressure of another kind to bear : they fear that the environment will be polluted and that huge resources will be seized by the few to the detriment of the many . 
How are we to take a view on this ? 
I happen to have today read an interview with New York 's former mayor , Mario Cuomo , which , I think , provides the right steer and which I should like you to hear . 
Former mayor Cuomo said that , in the field of biotechnology , the sole focus should be life which is the most precious thing that man has to protect . 
If we place life , which is the most sacred thing we have , at the centre of our political , philosophical and scientific considerations , then progress will be painless . 
I am therefore in favour of establishing the directive in full because I am thinking of life , of the life of the many sick people who are waiting for it and have written to us . 
Some may perhaps have had some relationship with the industry 's lobby which wants the directive at any cost ; but it is a fact that there are sick people ; it is a fact that pharmaceuticals have already been discovered using the new techniques of genetic manipulation and that other , more important ones may be found . 
But for the very same reason that I am favour of the basic fabric of the directive , I also believe that guidelines and categorical limits have to be established . 
Those limits are the ones established by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights in the amendment to Article 9 . 
However much I wish to defend the directive , I believe that its long passage , that it not over today , would be prejudiced if all of the limits provided for in Article 9 were to be changed and abolished . 
I have to say that Mr Rothley is right here when he says that what we want to protect through patenting are the inventions and not genes or genetic sequences . 
But in that case we need to take to follow through principle that it is the invention that is to be protected and not the gene , so that the invention is linked to a specific statement of industrial authorization . 
We have already said this in the Legal Affairs Committee and are repeating it here , and we hope that this is the direction the final text will take . 
Moving in that same direction , I ask you to consider , specifically because of the importance of the directive , the need to retain as it stands the committee 's amendment to Article 9 . 
Mr Rothley , it is not an old ideology that is at issue ; there is no reference to abortion or generally experimenting with embryos . 
It says only that human embryos should not be used for economic gain and that in an article which , rightly , provides that no suffering should be caused to animals . 
That is all it says ! 
It seems to me that the European Parliament , which sees the value of human beings as the basis for seeking investment for the benefit of man , should have the courage to engage in a simple process of reconciliation by accepting this limit along with the others . 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the text of Mr Rothley 's report has been long and difficult in the making . 
In 1995, as you will all recall , the House rejected the text produced by the Conciliation Committee , taking the view that it did not make plain enough the parameters and limits required in an area as sensitive as the patentability of biotechnological inventions . 
Thanks to the detailed and new work done by Mr Rothle. whom I congratulate on behalf of my grou. we now have a substantially clearer text that is able to meet the demands both of those who wish to guarantee European firms a favourable legal framework that does not perpetuate the disadvantage they suffer compared with their US and Japanese competitors and of those who are rightly determined not to abandon the protection of human beings and other living beings . 
The new proposal for a directive , based on Article 100a of the Treaty , contains a number of important points of reference . In particular , it makes a distinction between a discovery and an invention ; it refers to the principles of existing legislation regarding the conditions of patentability ; it rules out patentability for germinal genetic therapies applied to human beings ; it establishes that the human body and parts thereof in their natural state cannot be deemed to be patentable inventions ; it is designe. and this is a requirement that was stipulated and needs to be borne in min. to protect the interests of farmers in the livestock sector . 
The amendments adopted by the Legal Affairs Committee are designed to rule out patentability of , among other things , plant varieties and animal species , biological procedures for the production of plants and animals , parts of the human body at its various stages of development ; the simple discovery of the sequences contained in genes ; the procedures for human cloning or measures to modify the germinal line of human beings ; methods which make use of human embryos ; and inventions the use and publication of which are incompatible with ordre public and morality . 
The latter , in particular , is an element that will certainly be the source of a great deal of work for the courts and lawyers because we know just how different the concept of ordre public and morality can be , depending on the time and the place . 
Nonetheless , this is part of a general solution arrived at within the Legal Affairs Committee and one which , we believe , should be endorsed in all its aspects because , if it is not , it could again undermine the credibility of this House . 
We believe that at a time when all eyes in Europ. and not just in Europ. are focusing on the work this House is doing , the worst thing would be were we to prove yet again to be incapable of taking a decision . 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , whatever is possible is permissible here . Is it right , Mr Rothley , to allow things just because they are possible ? 
We are debating principles today in a debate which transcends boundaries but for which quite new boundaries need to be set . 
At the heart of this debate is nothing less than responsibility . It is about morals and ethics . 
It is about the value of life . It is about the inviolability of nature . 
It is about human rights . 
Do this call for growth and progress and the illusory promise of more jobs not represent a threat to social welfare and the rule of law ? Do they not undermine the principle of respect for nature ? 
The patenting of living organisms and rejection of the inviolability of the individual are the result of an overweening arrogance that no longer knows any bounds . 
Who do we think we are , regarding evolution as private property and claiming ownership rights in respect of a life that has evolved over millions of years into millions of living organisms , our common heritage with its indescribable wealth of biological diversity ? 
Who do we think we are , believing we are entitled to set ourselves above the flora and fauna of this world in order finally to enslave humankind and turn people into exploitable commodities , into mere biological material ? 
Responsibility towards ourselves and our children 's children can only mean strict and consistent rejection . 
No patents for genes , plants , animals , people or their constituent parts ! 
We are committed to freedom of research and development . 
But we are opposed to any situation in which this freedom is liable to be restricted by excessive patenting , by the inaccessibility of scientific knowledge , due to its having become the preserve of individual groups of companies and hence of economic interests , and in which the right to acquire and share knowledge is a question of money . 
And we are committed to morality in politics . 
Above all else , morality means independence . 
We are not the caretakers of an unbridled competitive ideology in which policies are subordinated and attuned to these interests . 
I appeal to our social responsibility , which is something other than subjugation to the policies of BASF , Boehringer or whatever they are all called . 
I should have liked to see some of this independence from the rapporteur , because the separation of politics and morality can only result in immoral policies . 
Mr President , colleagues , two years ago the European Parliament rejected at the third reading the initial draft directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions . 
A unique event in the annals of the codecision procedure , this negative vote let it be known that our Assembly was not prepared to adopt illdefined legislation that has such a bearing on what human beings are most sensitive , namely their genetic heritag. gene poo. the opening of the book of life . 
One year ago , at the time of the public hearing organized by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights , we witnessed some fascinating and contrasting debates between the experts invited here to express their views on the legitimacy of patenting scientific research and development . 
That , I hear you say , was yesterday . 
Yes , but unfortunately between yesterday and today the debate has progressed very little and the blurred areas are still with us . 
Commercial interests have been increasingly insistent , the same pressure groups have been vocally advancing the same arguments , and throughout these two years the Commission , confusing speed with haste , has drafted a new fresh text which , while noticeably different , has still not altered the original concept , not one iota . 
What the Commission is actually doing is laying down a basic premise according to which patent law is relegated to a piece of technical legislation which , therefore , would more or less be confined to dealing with ethical questions , even when this law applies to living human material . 
In other words , it is setting the limits on patentability solely on the distinction between invention and discovery , thereby cleverly stifling all philosophical and political debate on the future of mankind . 
One or two questions come to mind . 
How is it that the Commission has never wondered about the pertinence of applying the principles of patent law to living tissue and , in particular , to human living tissue , nor about the pertinence of adapting these principles ? 
It is really quite a fundamental point . 
What are we to make of the report passed by the Legal Affairs Committee ? 
It is in fact an imperfect clone of the Commission 's draft . 
A clone , in the sense that the Legal Affairs Committee manifestly takes the same strict legal view as to the manner in which patent law should apply to living human tissue . 
Imperfect , because it is necessary nevertheless to emphasize the considerable improvements introduced by Members to Articles 3 and 9 of the text , which spell out the relevant ethical principles . 
The fact remains that the affirmation of ethical principles is always unsatisfactory . 
No higher principles , such as the preservation of the human body from exploitation or respect for human dignity underpin measures of a legal nature . 
Amendment No 81, tabled by the ARE Group , seeks to re - establish the supremacy of Man and the idea that science should be a tool at the service of the individual , and not the other way round . 
Even when these ethical principles are explicitly written dow . 
I am referring here to Amendment No 11 of the Legal Affairs Committee which establishes the principle of excluding patentability of the human body , its parts and its product. the principle of excluding products of the human body , such as blood , tears , sweat , sperm , is not to be found in Article 3, Amendment No 49, which deals with the non - patentability of the human body . 
This lack of rigour on the part of jurists who are so insistent on the strict application of patent law , I find surprising . 
Another inconsistency is the affirmation , in Article 4, of the principle of excluding from patentability plant species and the animal species , when what is meant by the animal species is not even defined . 
I also find it regrettable that ethical principles are diluted in a heterogeneous whole . 
What is the point of including , in Article 9, a reference to the basic legal principles of high moral standards and public order , in drawing up an exhaustive list of the types of genetic manipulations that are to be strictly prohibited , and therefore non - patentable , and in including a reference to the quantification of pain in laboratory animals ? 
Does not legal rigour justify having a statute dealing specifically with the human body ? 
It is inept and misleading to try to present an ethical principle as being common to animals , plants and human beings . 
The Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee have not done that . 
They are therefore going to be condemned by our Group if our proposals continue to be ignored . 
Mr President , the subject tackled by the Rothley report is a difficult one which , as others have said on occasions , is of direct concern to every delegate in this Parliament and touches upon the deeply - held convictions of each one of us . 
I also cast my mind back to the questions that arose on that difficult day , 1 March 1995, when the time came for us to cast our votes . 
It strikes me that this is a subject on which it is not possible to have a Group vote , as I have heard suggested now and again . 
It is up to each one of us to search his or her own soul and conscience , and in what I have to say I shall be speaking for myself . 
To begin with , let me say that I have some sympathy with the argument that the European Union needs a directive in this area . 
It is true that we do have patent law at international level ; this fact is mentioned in the draft that we have before us . 
There are also the various national laws : in France , for example , there is the Law of 29 July 1994 . 
But there is probably a need for something more , something to introduce at least a measure of harmonization and will make for greater efficiency at European level . 
Clearly , whatever we fail to do ourselves will be done elsewhere . 
I must admit that I also have some sympathy with the argument that we do need to have treatments for a whole host of diseases . 
Serious diseases , often of genetic origin , affect millions of people . 
But I , like many of my colleagues , am wondering about our very real ethical concerns . 
Have they been taken sufficiently into account ? 
There is of course a need for a directive that will allow biotechnological inventions to be patented whe. and only whe. such inventions are of real use to society ; a directive that offers a meaningful response to suffering . 
The human body is not patentable ; only products created by Man can be patentable . 
The work of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights has been useful . 
Have we gone far enough ? 
I am wondering in particular about the patentability of animals . 
The results of the votes on the amendments will give us the answers to these and other questions . 
Even though , a priori , I am for the time being inclined to vote in favour , I shall wait to see the results of the voting before finally making up my mind . 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there is absolutely no good reason why the European Parliament should cut off its own nose . 
And that is the danger today . 
On 1 March 1995, after difficult and intensive negotiations , we rejected by a clear majority a directive on the patenting of biotechnological inventions . 
Today we are dealing with this matter again . 
The wording is new , the content old . 
I could take the easy option and suggest that we vote ' no ' as we did last time . 
That would be wrong . 
Biotechnological inventions help people , not only in medicine but in other areas too . 
So these inventions must be protected , not for the sake of interested companies ' bank balances but for the benefit of the women and men of our countries . 
The discovered parts of the human body must not be redefined as inventions , which would make them patentable . 
It is unacceptable that individual organizations should have a sole right of disposal over these . 
Genes and gene sequences must remain the common property of humanity and be freely accessible to researchers for the benefit of all people . 
That is the political decision before us . 
The existing law on patents has nothing to do with this . 
It is capital - centred and does not focus on people . 
Our duty as Members of the European Parliament is to serve 370 million children , women and men . 
This obligation underlies amendments 71 to 76 . 
That is why we tabled them . 
Let me repeat that I am not against the patenting of biotechnological inventions . 
I am against any attempt to patent human parts , animals and plants , to declare such discoveries to be inventions , thereby making them patentable . 
Mr President , this is now the tenth year of discussion and consultation concerning the Directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions . 
Part of the reason for this interminable process is the fact that the legal categorization of this Directive as a singlemarket directive designed to harmonize patents law in Europe has repeatedly been lost from view . 
Time and again there have been attempts to limit or even to reduce the scope of patent rights by overloading the Directive with rules which have no basis in patent law . 
Three aspects of the Directive are under discussion : the legal , the economic and the ethical aspects . 
Harmonization of the Member States ' legal provisions in this domain has become necessary as a means of countering the divergence between the development of legislation and that of jurisprudence in the Member States . 
The danger of further legal fragmentation must be confronted . 
We need legal consistency . 
In the economic domain , it is a matter of encouraging inventions and innovations , not of promoting imitation . 
The competitiveness of European industry must be fostered , and European researchers must be motivated to remain in Europe , to conduct research in Europe and not to emigrate overseas . 
To that extent the Directive is also a key instrument of European employment policy . 
How and to what extent ethical aspects are to be integrated into the Directive has always been the real powder keg of this Directive . 
This has been demonstrated again by a number of today 's speeches . 
Patent law governs the legal relationship between the inventor and third parties . 
It does not govern the actual right of utilization . 
Although patent law lays down that inventions cannot be patented if their publication or exploitation would be contrary to public policy , the fact remains that both research and the use of research findings are governed by other laws , such as the Genetic Engineering Act or the Embryo Protection Act . 
Public policy , or ordre public , is defined by the central provisions of the various national constitutions and the statutes derived from them . 
In other words , patent offices are not responsible for controlling technological development . 
In the form in which it was adopted by the Legal Affairs Committee , the Directive merits our full support . 
The vital thing now is that those who are aware of the importance , and hence also of the limitations , of patent law should prevail and that this Directive can soon be adopted . 
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , when in March 1995 we voted on the first directive on the patentability of biotechnologies , I voted in favour . 
Today , there are at least two reason why I am pleased that that directive has been revived : firstly , because I am convinced that the present directive is better , because the definitions it contains are more precise , as has been stressed by others who have spoken before me . Secondly , because we have had the remarkable scientific achievement of the cloned sheep and , more recently , the announcement that it is possible to manufacture blood plasma using biotechnology . 
These innovations have made it possible to extend the public debate and actually to compare the imaginary with the possible and perceptions with knowledge . 
We may wonder whether during this 18 month delay , research into biotechnology and the biotechnology industry in Europe have suffered a competitive setback compared with their American and Japanese counterparts and whether capital and jobs have been lost . 
I fear the industry will confirm that this has indeed happened . 
The importance of this issue and the new area of life we are penetrating , public suspicion of the progress of science and technology , which is sometimes confused with certain doubtful exploits in the area of human procreation , mean that we have to exercise great caution and be considerate of sensitivities . 
It therefore seems to me to be very important that , moving beyond the directive we are approving , all of those involved in this frontier sector should undertake to enhance the information available in such a way as make it easier to understand and dispel the fear that comes with ignorance . 
I have great confidence in the ethics committee that has been set up and in the debate that we in the Committee on Research and Technology shall be pursuing further in the context of the Fifth Framework Programme . 
Mr President , the European institutions have been discussing the subject of patent protection for biotechnological inventions for over ten years now , and since I have had the honour of being the chairman of the Legal Affairs Committee , we have had no less than 15 meetings on the new Commission proposal between January and June this year , resulting in 250 amendments and 47 compromise amendments . 
So you can see that the institutions in general and Parliament in particular have been treading extremely carefully in dealing with this delicate subject , on which it goes without saying that all views should be heard . 
Have we now reached the limits of what is humanly possible in biotechnological research ? 
Some people would say yes , while scientists think that we have only just begun , so it is up to us as politicians to provide a clear and correct legal framework . 
Looking objectively at the text which is now before us , I think it tries to strike a fair balance between those who wish to go further and those who oppose any research whatsoever , between the technical and the ethical . 
I would call on everyone here to have the courage to face up to this new challenge , and to ensure that we introduce appropriate , clear and fair legislation to control our own inventiveness and our constant urge to push back the limits of our ability . 
Mr President , as everyone here is aware , biotechnology has developed rapidly in many areas . 
The economic and commercial interests involved are enormous and serve to stimulate financial appetites . 
It is undeniably true that in this area Europe has definitely failed to keep up with international competition . 
One of the ways of meeting this scientific , industrial and commercial challenge is to make up the lost ground and to harmonize national legislations . 
This would make it possible to open up research activities and to put an end to market segmentation . 
At the conclusion of the codecision procedure , this directive was rejected by the European Parliament in March 1995 because the ethical dimension had not been taken sufficient account of . 
Since then , the Commission has submitted a new draft directive on the protection of biotechnological inventions by patents , at the same time setting out the conditions and the exceptions to patentability . 
It is true that some of Parliament 's proposals have been taken on board , but once again the ethical requirements that the patenting of human tissue makes indispensable have not been adequately taken into account . 
I would draw attention to the fact that my country prohibits the patenting not only of the human body , its parts and its products , but also of the knowledge of the total or partial structure of the human gene . 
These ethical principles should , in my view , be embodied in the draft directive . 
This is vital if serious violations are to be prevented and human dignity is to be safeguarded . 
The argument advanced here is that such restrictions would hinder research . 
I really cannot go along with that , as researchers would be the first to alert us . 
I therefore believe that the directive as it stands would leave the door open to every possible abuse and is still geared to satisfy strictly commercial interests . 
Mr President , colleagues , a debate that presents itself in a purely legal guise may conceal more important questions , and we are seeing today , first of all , just how much is at stake economically , as Mr Monfils recalled a short time ago , and as the barrage of lobbying to which we have all been subjected rather crudely reveals . 
We are also seeing what can only be described as an ideological clash between humanism and liberalism , and on top of that we have some interesting cross - currents muddying the more usual political divisions which have been revealed for example by the speech of our colleague Mr Casini , or the thoughtful speech of Mr FabreAubrespy . 
So , is what we are debating here today really a legal problem ? 
If it is , then we have our various national legislations , we have a European convention , some intimations from the European Observatory , and we have a worldwide agreement reached within the framework of the World Trade Organization . 
Well , I do not believe that this is a purely legal problem but rathe. and we need to be on our guard her. it is an extension of the scope of patentability to include living tissue . 
If it is technical or economic problem , the draft directive and the report are based on a prior assumption : it is patents that open the way to technological progress . 
Is that actually true ? 
For my part I believe quite the opposite , that patents , as Mr Telkämper said a moment ago , often simply allow the weak to be robbed by the strong . 
One could be cynical and choose , for economic reasons , to side with the strong , but that would not be my personal choice in this matter . 
An another thing : who says that the system of patents necessarily helps progress ? 
I know of a thousand examples which show that patents , because of the possibility of their being bought out , can actually stifle scientific and technical progress . 
I myself believe that we do most certainly have an ethical problem . 
Everyone in their own way , the Commission and the rapporteur , are saying to us : ' listen , let us not talk about morality , let us not talk about ethics , let us not talk about humanism , that is not where the question lies ; it is all to do with law , with trade , with business ' . 
Personally I do not go along with that at all and I do not believe that one can accuse of obscurantism people like Mr Monfils and other speakers who feel a kind of medieval terror in the face of technological progress . 
I have listened to the remarks by Mrs Roth , Mrs Ainardi and Mr Scarbonchi : many of us believe that this text should have had a moral and ethical preamble explaining the technical choices we would have to make in retrospect . 
We know that man has acquired the means of total self - destruction and the means of infinite self - replication . 
This progress cannot therefore be limited to its technical and commercial aspects . 
It was not I who said : ' Science without conscience ruins the soul ' . 
Now it is true that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights has improved this text . 
We have been listening attentively to this morning 's debate and we shall hear what the Commission has to say in response , any overtures they might make , and we shall see what happens to the tabled amendments before we come to any final decision , but as the directive stands at present our Group is not in favour of its adoption . 
Mr President , the debate on this directive has focused over the last year on technical legal aspects , rather than ethical considerations . 
I have nothing against this as such , since the legal content of the text has been much improved . 
However , I do still have considerable misgivings . 
The Commission and the rapporteur , Mr Rothley , have both chosen to give a broad interpretation to the TRIPS Agreement , to the effect that human genes , once identified and isolated , can be patented . 
They claim that this interpretation is the only proper technical solution , and that all other suggestions are based not on technical considerations , but on sentiment . 
I have two reactions to this . 
The first is ethical , based not on cheap sentiment , but on the conviction that man is God 's unique creation and thus cannot , either in whole or in part , be called a human invention . 
Isolating a gene is , in itself , a technical tour de force , but calling genetic material taken from the body an invention is somewhat presumptuous . 
Furthermore , such a patent would inevitably have a very broad scope when it comes to new applications using the gene in question . 
Secondly , I think that adopting a technical legal approach to a problem does not imply that there can only be one correct solution , as Mr Rothley claims . 
There still remains a freedom of choice which politicians have to exercise responsibly . 
In my opinion , the Commission document and the Rothley report both do their best to twist the terms invention , innovation and technical application so that the human gene can be made to fit into the strait - jacket of patent law . 
The interpretation given in the Gebhardt amendment seems much more natural to me . 
I therefore feel that there is a much more valid case for patenting products or production methods based on the discovery of a gene . 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the thrust of the Rothley report on the proposal for a directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions has , in my view , been brought well into focus by those who have spoken , including Mr Casini . 
The passage of the report in its final form has been a difficult one , but it seems to me that we have achieved our goal with the confirmation that : life has to be protected , the embryo must not be exploited for financial gain and the industry has to be protected from US and Japanese competition . 
I shall not discuss the merits of the amendments which we shall be debating tomorrow at the vote . 
We in the Alleanza Nazionale shall be voting in favour of the report as a whole and those amendments that are designed to protect life , the embryo and moralit. and on this occasion morality and politics will have to work togethe. but not those which will have the effect , from a legal and biological point of view , of distorting the physiological in the strict sense of the word . 
I should like now to say a few words about patents . 
I agree with the Committee on Development and Cooperation that patentability of living entities has a negative impact , at both an ethical and a practical level , for the human race , the animal kingdom and the environment . 
To conclude , therefore , we need to avoid patents on the following : the human body , parts of the human body , human tissue and all genetic material derived from human sources ; animals , parts of animals , animal tissue , genetic modification processes , plants , seeds , vegetable tissue and other reproductive material . 
Ladies and gentlemen , we have to safeguard life , protect morality and avoid distorting what the Eternal Father has given us . 
Only in that way will we be able to meet the challenge of the times while at the same time making progress in research . 
Est modus in rebus , as Horace put it ! 
Mr President , I do not feel that the importance of these discussions has to be emphasized any further . 
It suffices to take note of the amount of informatio. sometimes disinformatio. which we Members have received concerning this directive . 
In principle I would like to point out that we should resist all attempts to manipulate this directiv . 
' manipulation ' means saying things that the directive does not say or asserting things which are allegedly necessary and which are already contained in the directive . 
I have been listening to much talk of morals and rights , morals and politics , and I totally support these views , but this has nothing to do with the directive . 
The directive itself upholds moral principles , confirms the need to observe good practices and to maintain public order and a number of assertions are made concerning matters which are intolerable . 
Moreover , the directive is being asked to give more than it is able to . 
In Spain , there is a song which goes ' I went to sea for oranges , something the sea does not have ' , quite obviously , and here , too , we are sometimes asking for the impossible . 
What we are dealing with here is a law on patents . 
There are other ethical standards . 
The Commission has a Working Group on ethics , and at these very Council of Europe headquarters , approval has been given to a convention on the protection of human rights vis - à - vis manipulation of a medical nature . 
All this already exists and already forms part of the background against which this directive is being formulated . 
Nor do we have to succumb to slogans . 
I believe that the previous directive collapsed mainly because of the existence of a slogan which ran ' No patents on life ' . 
Fortunately , in these discussions , there has been a different sloga . ' Patents to promote life ' . 
There are also those who desire patents in order that life should continue . 
In conclusion , I feel that I must recommend that everyone should read the directive before voting . 
On a closing note , I would like to congratulate Mr Rothley because not only has he largely captured the feeling behind the amendments but has altered practically the entire directive , has made it more systematic from the outset , and it is my belief that the majority of those of us who are members of the Committee on Legal Affairs feels that we are properly represented by the work he has done . 
Mr President , we had a great battle with Mr Langer in 1995 to defeat this directive . 
At the time , Mr Langer was staunch in his defence of plants and animals while I was for the embryo and therefore human beings . 
Combining those two elements , human beings and plants and animals caused a great deal of confusion in people 's minds and caused much time to be lost . 
Had they been kept separate , we should long since have entered into competition with the United States and Japan , and we need that for development in Europe and to create jobs . 
The Rothley report is today being submitted to us once again . 
I think that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights has done a great job . 
I personally approve of what they have done . 
I call for Article 9 in particular to be kept as it is and invite the House to adopt it as it stands , without changing anything . 
Mr President , not surprisingly this debate has generated huge public interest and I think that it poses a challenge to this Parliament as a legislature to face maturely our responsibilities . 
The Rothley report , in my opinion , as the product of a prolonged debate , is an effective , balanced and reasonable proposal and I congratulate the rapporteur . 
Mrs Roth , speaking earlier for the Greens , spoke of her belief in the need for morality in politics . 
I share that belief strongly which is why on this occasion I feel at ease in supporting this report and do so in good conscience . 
A clear distinction is drawn between discovery and invention . 
Patents on human bodies , on human cloning , on embryos and on altering the human germ line are all banned in the draft from the Legal Affairs Committee . 
Farmers ' privilege is explicitly protected for reseeding and breeding animals on their own land , as is the case today . 
Emphasis is placed by Parliament on the need to respect the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and to protect against fears of bio - piracy in respect of the underdeveloped world and the environment , and these two are important obligations which cannot be set aside . 
Again today my mailbox is full of letters , not least from groups in my own country representing those who suffer from genetic and other medical disorders currently without a cure , requesting support for this measure because it offers them some hope . 
In conscience I will not vote against offering that hope . 
We have also suggested an ethics committee . For all of these reasons I believe that this is effective but also balanced , and this time round , unlike before , I am happy to give it my support . 
Mr President , may I begin by thanking Sierra Gonzalez for her contribution , which I fully support . I also think that current legislation must be made to satisfy society 's new demands , particularly with regard to the ethical and social impact . 
There ought to be , as indeed there are , big differences between technological industrial inventions and those issues under discussion here today . 
Here , the patent holder is being given even greater licence to exercise power and control as a result of the monopoly position in which he may find himself , and I see this as a potential obstacle to development , particularly of small and medium sized companies . 
I think that the discovery of the function of a gene , for example , should be just that , a fantastic discovery which should be available for the service of the global community and not primarily for the interests of private , economic profit . 
I very much regret that politically we have not progressed towards real , practical proposals which promote global co - operation instead of commercial competition , especially as there is such a serious issue at stake here , the health and biological diversity of mankind , not just in the European Union but in the whole world . 
Mr President , Commissioner Monti , the European Parliament would forfeit its credibility if it adopted the Rothley report , which is totally unacceptable in terms of ethics and morality . 
Parliament will be a laughing - stock if it adopts a report to which it was still opposed on 1 March 1995, on the basis that the Commission keeps making it vote until it comes up with the desired result , until Parliament has bowed before the genetic engineering industry . 
The new proposal still provides for the patenting of living organisms . 
Even human genes can be patented ; the only proviso is that they must be isolated from the human body . 
If Parliament adopts this report , it will have set its seal on one of the greatest and most scandalous property redistributions in history . 
Life would become a commodity , a product . 
As Klondyke fever sets in , humankind will be reduced to a source of raw materials which can be exploited at will . 
That will violate human dignity . 
The human race will be degraded to mere biological material and the human body to a marketable commodity . 
If Parliament approves this report , the ethical floodgates will come under intense pressure . 
Human dignity and selfdetermination will be bartered away in the marketplace . 
For the first time since the abolition of slavery , it will be possible to claim property rights over human beings . 
Is our life an invention ? 
Life is not an invention of genetic engineers . 
Not even the cloning of body cells , as was done in the case of Dolly the sheep , or the patenting of biological weapons are excluded in the Legal Committee 's report . 
For the first time , treatments and diagnoses of patients will become patentable . 
That will restrict treatment options in a life - threatening manner . 
The patenting of living matter will lead to an huge upsurge in the commercialization of medicine . 
Doctors will no longer be free to choose the most effective treatment . 
A two - tier system of health care will be firmly established . 
The directive does not set out a fundamental position on genetic engineering . 
The patenting of a medicinal drug produced by means of genetic engineering will be entirely unimpeachable , despite the fact that the gene in question , which has existed for centuries , could never be called an invention . 
The patenting of genetic material will stifle applied research and impede innovation . 
That emerges clearly from the patenting of umbilical - cord blood cells , which has erected a barrier to applied leukaemia research . 
Patents will establish a monopoly on all uses of genes , including potential future uses . 
We are using this directive to privatize nature . 
I therefore appeal to you to reject the report as it now stands and to adopt the amendments tabled by the Green Group . 
That is the only way to ensure that the moral floodgates are not forced open here in the European Parliament . 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , after eight years of indecision it does seem high time now to change the European legislation on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions . 
The text put forward by the Commission this time does largely take account of the vitally important ethical standards of natural law on the matter , in particular excluding the human body from that which can be patented . 
Even though in this area we should have liked the text to have been a little more precise and , to that extent we would have been in favour of adding to the text as it presently stands Mrs Sandbaek 's Amendment No 84, which would impose a total ban on all manipulations involving not just the human body , but embryos as well . 
We do of course need to take into account those patients who are hoping for advances that would enable them to be treated more effectively thanks to these new technologies . 
Lastly , it is worth reminding ourselves of what the purpose of patents is : it is to reward inventors for their creative activities by giving them the exclusive right to do as they wish with their invention for a period of twenty years . 
They are an encouragement to innovation , investment and job creation . 
Well , we know that our legislation as it stands today leaves us powerless in the face of American and Japanese competition . 
According to the rapporteur himself , as he says in his explanatory memorandum , only 24 % of patents accepted by the European Patent Office are of European origin . 
Well , it is my belief that behind the outpourings of moral indignation that we have heard and which , in some cases , I am sure are genuine , I think that quite often there are powerful transatlantic economic interests are behind these attitudes . 
And it would not be for the first time either . 
For these reasons , therefore , I shall be voting for the text , which represents a good compromise between the various constraints under which our legislators have to work , but I would once again stress the need for Mrs Sandbaek 's Amendment No 84 to be added to the rapporteur 's text . 
Madam President , in recent weeks Members of this Parliament have been subjected to a barrage of misinformation on this subject , which has been orchestrated by the Green movement . 
On BBC Prime Time , at 7 a.m. this morning , the item on this debate was largely inaccurate in relation to the content of the draft directive . 
The key phrase of the Green propaganda machine has been : ' no patents on life ' . 
As Mr Verde i Aldea mentioned a few moments ago , it was the same two years ago . 
One of the very sad things about the current discussion is that the campaign against the directive has ignored fact and ignored the very substantial changes that have been negotiated to allay legitimate concerns and fears that genetic research will involve the reproductive system . 
It is a great pity that the changes that have taken place have not been recognized by the opponents of the directive . 
We have to recogniz. it is a very unpalatable though. that most of the medicine we take does not actually effect a cure : it only relieves the symptoms . 
Vaccination and antibiotics have dealt with many of the life - threatening illnesses of the past . 
As we live longer we are subjected to a different type of disease : cancer , heart disease , Parkinson 's , Alzheimer ' s . 
These are all diseases which have a genetic element in them and the developments in biotechnology and genetic engineering bring some hope that there might be a cure . 
I am supporting the directive not just on medical grounds but also because biotechnology brings a cleaner world ; , it brings a world which is more energy - efficient ; and , I believe , it offers us the hope not only of a longer life but of a healthier life in the future . 
The opponents of the directive should ponder what they are trying to prevent . 
Madam President , it is not my wish today to go back over the technical aspects of patentability , but rather to focus on those aspects that have to do with the patentability of living beings . 
Thanks to the excellent work of the rapporteur and the European Parliament , the new directive now takes account of ethical and social aspects in being based on a coherent approach . 
There is a difference between discovery and invention : a gene is not lif. one has to make a distinction between the whole and its parts . 
Genetic engineering is not about the manipulation of embryos : it is important to distinguish between the cellular machinery and the passing on of hereditary traits . 
The compromise amendments ensure respect for the living being from its conception until its ultimate death , the non - commercialization of the human body and of its parts , the banning of any manipulations involving embryos or germ - line cells , the outlawing of cloning for purposes of reproducing the human species . 
For my part , it seems to me ethical to ensure recognition of the added value associated with the intelligence and creativity of human beings , without which there can be no lasting progress . 
The new directive is not only based on the harmonization of patent law , but also takes account of the characteristics that are peculiar to human beings and to the living world ; it protects inventors , it safeguards preferential treatment for farmers , allows the development of products resulting from biotechnology to satisfy the need of sick people and their families for treatments for leukaemia and cancer thanks to cell growth factors , treatments for haemophilia , for diabetes , thanks to purified , non - contaminating product . I stress the fact that they are non - contaminatin. all of these more effective than the products used at present . 
It makes it possible to treat not only those major genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis and myopathy , but also certain rare diseases , the so - called orphan diseases . 
Finally , let us not forget that a patent is not an exploitation licence . 
Let us not confuse the protection of inventions with the marketing of products derived from biotechnologies , which really owe more to subsidiarity . 
In the preparation of such a directive our Parliament has exercised its responsibility of democratic control with a view to securing recognition for research and researchers and for the economic competitiveness of the European Union in the respect for life , respect for human beings and respect for the rights of the individual . 
Madam President , all that can be said on this issue has really already been said . 
Unfortunately , it has become something of a dialogue of the deaf and there are also a number of inaccuracies involved , which Mr Adam also pointed out earlier . 
The deciding factor for me , when my group and I adopted our position on this , was something which Mr Pompidou has already mentioned , and that is the fact that it is patent legislation which is under consideration . Everything which can be patented does not automatically gain a licence for use , at national level for example . 
All too frequently during the debate we have forgotten that we are in Europe . 
We have a European patent tradition which has meant that traditionally we have set strict standards for patents and required a high level of detail in all applications . 
We have a European Convention to protect human dignity in the application of medicine and biology ; this also applies to patents . 
I hope that biotechnological research will help us to make progress in all those medical challenges which the experts have spoken about here in this Assembly . 
The real inequality affects those who would survive only if they were able to afford 200 000 marks for a drug , but do not have the means to do so . 
Ladies and gentlemen , looking at the other side of the coin , we should also be sufficiently humble to say that this is a new form of patent and that , today , we do not know what the consequences of research in this area will be . 
So , if the unacceptable occurs , we must be prepared to review the legislation . 
This is why it is important that the Commission and the ethical committee report back to this Parliament . 
Ladies and gentlemen , in view of the present importance of this draft directive , as well as its far greater future importance , I do not intend to deal with the opportunities it offers . 
These have in any case been sufficiently discussed already . 
My purpose is rather to draw attention to the dangers that might lie ahead if we approve this draft , dangers which we should bear in mind when we come to cast our vote . 
What I mean is that the prospect of short - term gains should not induce us to put our future in hock to this extent . 
On the contrary , the reservations expressed by numerous experts should be taken seriously and examined carefully . 
Let me give you an example to illustrate the importance of our decisions . The draft before us lays down that the human genome and the gene sequences it contains are to be patentable . 
That must be firmly rejected , for the human genome in any form is common property to which anyone should have unhindered access . 
Reserving that right for individuals would enable them to monopolize knowledge of the uses and applications of the genome . 
Another argument against the patentability of human DNA sequences is that it would prevent the use of specific sequence variations by anyone other than the patent - holder and would thereby hinder research . 
For these reasons we shall reject the directive , and we know that our position has the support of the 1.2 million fellow Austrians who signed the national petition on this subject . 
Madam President , in the short contribution I am about to make I do not want to enter into the details of many of the passages of this very important directive , nor into the technical and scientific details which this is not the place to describe or explain . 
We in the Italian delegation of the Socialist Group consider that the result achieved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights , particularly through the efforts of the rapporteur , Mr Rothley , is balanced overall and the product of careful and keen study . 
We consider that it should be supported , even though there may , clearly , be amendments designed to improve or clarify it . 
We should remember that we are basically deal here with a very precise element , namely patent law and the fact that this directive makes a clear distinction between discovery and invention . 
A discovery is not and cannot be the subject - matter of a patent . 
Only an invention can be patented : the product then of an intellectual process of research which needs this guarantee if it is to provide a fundamental point of reference for industrial development also . 
We think that the ethics committee that is to be set up has an important role to perform , even though it should not have direct legal function . 
This is not an ideological or teleological debate on life but a lay instrument designed to guarantee , regulate and harmonize a European area for biotechnolog. an area that is now more than ever necessary if we think about what is happening at an international level . 
If Europe follows the example of the American system and we work together , by 200. according to expert forecast. biotechnology will really take off and become competitive , providing work for between 1.5 and 3 million people in Europe , while at the same time guaranteeing the right to health and the development of research and industry . 
If this is not done , if the industry , politics , research and the mass media do not work together , then Europe 's budding biotechnology industry will never flourish , and , as has already happened with information technology , Europe will become a biotechnological dependency . 
Madam President , any speech made at this stage of the debate enables one to state , quite simply , ' I reject this ' and ' I support this ' . 
Well , then , I reject the empty rhetoric we have had to listen to today in this House , I reject the value judgements and totally gratuitous attempts which have been made simply to bring discredi . I would almost describe this as personal discredi. and I support the significant contributions we have also heard . 
The first of the latter came from you , Mr Rothley . You have both my recognition and my admiration . 
I also support the important statements we have heard from my illustrious and admired colleague , Mr Casini , and Mr Cot 's clear observations , Mr Fabre - Aubrespy 's sharp commentary and the well - informed contribution from Mr Pompidou . 
I could , quite simply , end here , yet I will go one step further . 
I will be voting for the Rothley report and I will be voting in favour despite the fact that , in my opinion , it contains a number of significant technical shortcomings , such as amendments 42 and 43 to recitals 39 and 40, which are incorrect as I see it , or amendment 45 to paragraph 2 of Article 1 . 
I shall also be voting in favour , irrespective of the result , of subparagraph 2d ) of Article 9, i.e. the issue of the use or the patentability of inventions in which embryos are used . 
Why am I doing this ? 
I am doing so because the darkest , deepest and most atavistic convictions come together in this Aleph which is current biotechnological research , an industry which , in 2000, will have a turnover estimated at ecu 83, 000 million . 
In addition , this situation affects every single one of us , but still Europe looks to the past . The law , once again , is not only three paces behind social realit. as the German classicist used to sa. but way behind social reality . 
Because , let 's not forge. by way of illustratio. between 1981 and 1995, 1175 DNA patents were granted worldwide . We are not legislating for the future , we have to keep in step with a reality which is pressing in on us from all sides , a reality we have to guide towards legal standards . 
I shall also be voting in favour because of the economic reasons which have been set forth , but , above all , Madam President , I shall be voting in favour for a fundamental reason which , in my opinion , constitutes the very basis of the discussions we are currently involved in . 
In spite of all thi . 
I shall soon be finishe . I shall be voting in favour of this directive , in the conviction that it is a step that has to be taken and that we still have a great deal of time left in which to improve it . 
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , there are two industrial sectors that will be providing a great many jobs throughout the world over the next few years : information technology and biotechnology . 
In both fields , the European Parliament has the power to determine where those jobs will be created , in Europe or elsewhere in the world . 
So far , Parliament has failed to recognize the growth in the biotechnology industry by providing it with the proper patent legislation it needs for economic support , and after nine years we have still not achieved harmonization at European level . 
This House suffers from a peculiar syndrome known as the patent - for - life syndrome . 
More than 95 % of all Europe 's biotechnology firms are SMEs , the very sector where Europe 's potential for innovation and job - creation lies . 
However , their innovation is being stymied by the fact that protection for biotechnological inventions is fragmented and , in comparison with the United States and Japan , very expensive . 
It costs on average ECU 19 000 to submit to the European Patent Office a patent application covering eight countries , a market volume similar to that of the United States . 
In the United States , it costs ECU 1500 . Europe is at the forefront scientifically , but we do not capitalize on our knowledge , and this is costing us jobs . 
Biotechnology has many very promising applications , such as in the prevention and cure of hereditary diseases in particular . 
Ladies and gentlemen , we do not have the right to choose whether other people should go through life healthy or handicapped . 
That is why my group intends to vote for this excellent report by Mr Rothley and the patents directive . 
Madam President , one of the principles of the Christian faith is that all living beings should be regarded as God 's creatures . 
If that is to be more than just a pious saying , it must mean that the physical , genetic and creative integrity of our fellow creatures is a legal right that has to be protected , and protected in every area of the law , including patent law , Mr Rothley . 
The directive in front of us only does that to a limited and unsatisfactory extent , and at certain points it even abolishes such protection , as in Amendment 74 . 
It does that because , as the rapporteur himself says on page 32 of his report , the directive concurs with those who demand the industrial exploitation of life . 
That is what we reject ! 
Not freedom of research , not the development of therapies , not the progress of the biotechnological industry , but the fact that the whole thing is being subordinated to very specific economic interests , as has just been very clearly reemphasized . 
Whoever does that must not be surprised if he has to rescind the new cloning ban within a short time for the very same reasons that have been advanced in support of the directive . 
Life does not exist so that it can be industrially exploited ; on the contrary , industrial exploitation exists to support life . 
That is why the law is there and for no other reason ! 
Madam President , sometimes in politics , as in life in general , you have to hold your hands up and say : I got it wrong . 
I have to say that the European Parliament got it wrong in 1995 when we rejected the original biotechnology directive and I got it wrong by voting along with the majority in Parliament at that time . 
The test , though , is not whether , from time to time you get things wrong but whether or not you learn from your mistakes . 
I am pleased to say that the European Parliament has learned from its mistake and that Mr Rothley has expertly guided this new proposal through the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights . 
I join with the many other Members who have paid tribute to his work over the last year or so . 
We now have a proposal which , on the one hand , balances the genuine need to protect inventions and the scientists and researchers who work towards creating those inventions and , yes , the companies who put resources into financing the research . 
They deserve a return on their investments . 
The present proposal is also fair to the patients groups . 
The most effective of the hundreds if not thousands of letters I have received on this subject have come from the patients groups . 
It is fair to the patients groups . 
It gives them hope that this relatively new branch of science will help in the treatment of genetic disorders and in cures for diseases such as cancer and AIDS . 
On the other hand and just as importantly , the new proposal provides safeguards for the environment ; it provides safeguards for animal welfare ; it respects existing international agreements ; it ensures that human cloning is outlawed . 
Two years ago we were seduced and panicked by the horror stories of those opposed to biotechnological research . 
I bear in mind the point Mr Liese made earlier that there is only hope but this time we should consider the aspirations of the thousands of Europeans who suffer from currently incurable diseases and illnesses and give them some hope by promoting this directive and bringing some order to the field of biotechnology . 
Madam President , in many respects what Mr Martin has just said echoes my own thoughts on the matter , though , unlike him , I am happy to confess that I actually supported the proposal when we last voted on it two years ago and I do not intend to change my intention this time . 
As Mr Adam pointed out earlier , most Members of the European Parliament have been subjected to a barrage of misinformation on this topic . 
I have here a file of misinformation . 
As many colleagues know , I yield to no - one in regarding the activities of lobbyists as important in helping us to do our job properly ; but in the end it is up to us as parliamentarians to make judgments as between one side of the argument and the other . 
I am quite clear on which side of the argument I would come down : the interests of the patients and the interests of the single market . 
Very few speakers today have made the point that this is a single market measure . 
It was first brought to this House by the Commission in 1988 . 
It will not be long before we reach 1998 . 
In a fast - moving industry the European Community has been lagging behind the very rapid progress made in the United States . 
Indeed , reference has been made to the fact that the chief beneficiaries of biotechnological patents will be large multinationals . 
That is absolute nonsense . 
In my own country we have 165 important small and medium - sized companies which are involved in biotechnology . 
The United States has 1, 300 . 
Surely we in Europe ought to be able at least to equal , if not to surpass , what the Americans are doing . 
Another part of the mythology is that currently there is no legislation about the protection of biotechnological patents here in Europe . 
There is ! 
There are 15 different sets of biotechnological patent law which cause confusion and chaos and add enormously to the expense of registering a patent . 
The intention of this proposal is to replace fifteen sets of national regulations with one set of European regulations . 
As for ethic. although I consider that the ethical consideration is not really appropriate in this directiv. the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights and its rapporteur have included in Amendment No 56 a new Article 9a setting up an ethics committee . 
As has been pointed out , we have also taken care of the interests of animals and , indeed , the interests of humans , though there seem to be some Members of this Parliament who think that animal rights are more important than human rights . 
In conclusion , I shall be supporting this directive and I hope that the Commission will be able to accept most , if not all , of the amendments of the Legal Affairs Committee . 
Madam President , it seems to me that the only clear argument from the rapporteur is that Europe should approve a provision on patenting in the field of biotechnology because the US and Japan already have similar legislation . 
That , Mr Rothley , is absurd because it means that we are subordinate to decisions already made in other countries . 
There is , however , nothing absurd about questioning the consequences of a decision of this nature , but the rapporteur was careful not to go into this . 
What does it mean to patent a living , albeit genetically modified , organism ? 
It means retaining an organism that is the product of human invention , but , scientifically and logically , this is wrong , in fact it looks suspiciously like the crazed desire for omnipotence of a sorcerer 's apprentice . 
In reality , the sole objective is financially to exploit discoveries in the field of biotechnology : and these are discoveries because genes can only be discovered or modified , they cannot be invented . 
No - one benefits from the kind of sophistry proposed by some of the amendments : it is nothing but hypocrisy to exclude the human body or parts of it from being patented because , in biological terms , man is an animal species . 
We ought therefore to conclude that what is not acceptable for human beings should not be acceptable for other animal organisms either . 
In fact , in the name of the economic interests of a few multinationals , we are attempting to establish a criterion that involves new experiments and fresh suffering for animals . 
We are then told that it is necessary to patent genes and gene therapies to meet the needs of the sick . 
I wish to point out that treatments of that kind are also available without being patented ; in fact , agreeing that they should be patented means encouraging research only into treatment that makes money for the multinationals . 
Consequently , those treatments will be available only to rich citizens and nations , but not to the world 's poor and , particularly , not to those who have very unusual illnesses which will not provide the multinationals with an adequate return . 
This is not about defending the sick ! 
I should also add that , as has already happened in the US , these genes are stolen from their genuine owners , for although they have them in their bodies , once they are patented they are no longer able to dispose freely of them . 
These are grave implications for the future of humanity , and they cannot be shrugged aside , as our rapporteur seeks to do . 
And so we are opposed to this . 
Madam President , I should like to use my speaking time to refer to some of the misunderstandings that have cropped up time and again in this debate , as on previous occasions . 
Contrary to the perceptions of many Members , the Rothley report certainly does provide for the patentability of human genes and of flora and fauna . 
I ask anyone who believes otherwise to read Articles 3 ( 2 ) and 1b carefully . 
Article 3 ( 2 ) refers to a gene isolated from the human body , but it must be said that even an isolated human gene is still a gene . 
Amendments 71 to 75, which Mrs Gebhardt and I have tabled , do not seek to prohibit patents ; their purpose is only to exclude those patents that go too far , because medical patients and the treatment of serious diseases , as well as the job situation in Europe , are equally pressing concerns of ours . 
Based on the principle of responsible research , our amendments certainly permit the patenting of processes and applications as well as of proteins , medicinal drugs , vaccines and many other products . 
That should provide the European biotechnological industry with enough incentive and reward , and many of its representatives echo that assessment . 
What we want to exclude is the applicability of product protection to primary genetic matter , both for ethical reasons and for research - policy considerations . 
Knowledge of the ways in which the human body works should remain freely accessible to society . 
It should not be the subject of exclusive property and exploitation rights . 
Product protection of primary genetic matter will provide a few European companies , but chiefly American and Japanese corporation. simply because they will be quicker to reac. with a European monopoly for many years to come . 
They will then be able to prevent other enterprises from using the patented genetic material or charge them high licence fees . 
My third point is that the proposed rules will also prove very costly for European farmers , for animal - breeders and plant - growers and consequently for consumers too . 
Costly by European standards , but prohibitively expensive by Third World standards . 
If animals and plants become patentable , and if such patents apply not only to the first generation but to all subsequent generations resulting from natural reproduction , even the envisaged farmer 's privilege will be of little help . 
I shall close by asking all Members of the House who are seeking to reconcile the various legitimate interests involved here to support our Amendments 71 to 75 . 
Madam President , during this debate on the Patent Directive I have been particularly upset by the fact that certain organisations representing patients , including the Danish Cystic Fibrosis Association , maintain that there is a ' Green Lobby ' which does not care a jot for the needs of seriously ill people . 
This is , of course , wrong ! 
The most sensational claim is that , without the Patent Directive , large companies would keep their research results secret . 
But it goes without saying that , in a democratic society where there is freedom of research , the results of that research should be freely available to all researchers without the need to pay a licence fee . 
What the Patent Directive means , as the Scandinavian Association against Painful Animal Tests has pointed out , is that a company can gain a monopoly over important genes which could create difficulties for the discovery of new drugs . 
The Rothley report also opens the way for the patenting of methods of treatment , as the term known as the doctor 's exemption is missing in the report . 
According to Sweden 's Christian Council this would mean that research would be blocked and that groups with few resources would be excluded from receiving the best possible treatment . 
Mr Adam said previously that there is a ' Green Propaganda Machine ' which has mounted a pressure campaign before this debate . 
This is absolutely ridiculous when you consider the enormous propaganda campaign carried out by the biotechnological industry to try to get a few Members of this Parliament to change their position from that which we adopted two years ago . 
So I must say that if this directive is adopted it will not only be a defeat for democracy but also a disgrace for the European Parliament . 
When it comes to the ethical committee , we have not said in that second amendment what it shall comprise , merely that the Commission shall come forward with a proposal . 
When it comes forward with that proposal we can consider what the ethical committee 's terms of reference shall be and who shall be on it . 
Let us make it a precondition for this directive coming into effect that an ethical committee shall be established and shall be a central part of our decision - making process . 
Madam President , after this long debate , I should like to dot some ' i 's ' and cross some ' t 's ' , and in particular two of them . 
The first relates to the concept of patents . 
Patents , in case it needs saying again , are a vital element which offer both legal and economic security , without which there would not be any inventions . 
Every time we raise these problems here we always make a point of emphasizing Europe 's weakness in the area of innovation . 
Now , the process of innovation is directly linked with the process of invention and , therefore , with protection . 
Six months ago now , we voted through a report of which I was the author and in which we drew attention to this European paradox of a Europe putting itself forward as a champion of discovery but a Europe poor in inventions . 
This report was passed unanimously . 
Well , I have to say that while some people here may be suffering , as Mr Rothley was saying earlier , from ' Legasthenia ' , they are also , curiously , suffering from amnesia ; and I am very much afraid that genetic engineering is not going to be of much help to them . 
The second thing I should like to highlight is the fact that a great deal has been said about humanism and morality . 
Humanism is clearly that which ensures that Man is the measure of everything , and especially those men and women who suffer in their bodies and in their minds those diseases for which no - one has yet come up with a cure and for whom genetic engineering offers considerable hope . 
This form of humanism has nothing whatever to do with the naturalism that we hear people talk about today , which regards idolized nature as a yardstick of I know not what judgement . 
I would say to Mrs Roth that if , indeed , morality invigorates politics , then just as surely moralism kills it . 
I fear that had we been called upon today to discuss Pasteur and his inventions , a part of this House would have condemned him , just as others condemned Galileo a few centuries ago ! 
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the rapporteur and I reached a fair compromise on Amendments 16 and 49 after lengthy discussions . 
They concern recitals 16a and 16e and Article 3 . 
One of their chief aims is to prevent abuses . 
Such abuses , which have in fact been tried already , could consist in patenting gene sequences without having any specific scientifically demonstrable application in mind . 
The formulation ' an industrial application must be disclosed ' draws a clear line . DNA sequences are not patentable just because they have been discovered . 
They can become patentable on the basis of explicitly described applications , such as the production of active substances . 
Anyone who has ever looked into the enormous expenditure that the development of such active substances entails will surely understand and recognize the moral justification , and indeed the necessity , of stimulating research and development by holding out the prospect of a patent . 
These are not , as the demagogues have claimed , patents on life but rather patents for life . 
Genetically engineered human hormones , for example , will be a monumental step forward for haemophiliacs , for anaemia sufferers and for patients with genetic metabolic disorders . 
In 1995, when this Parliament rejected the proposal for a so - called biopatent directive , many Members saw it as a moment of glory for the European Parliament . 
But it caused consternation among Europe 's biotechnologists , because outright rejection naturally deprived them of the upsurge in motivation which the draft directive was meant to provide . 
That , ladies and gentlemen , is why we are contributing now to a genuine red - letter day in the life of this Parliament . 
After nine long years , let us finally adopt this legislation . 
Madam President , Mr Rothley , you have argued very , very eloquently today in favour of employment , and you have undoubtedly imparted a sense of vision with regard to this entire issue . 
But there are still some small discrepancies between your oral presentation and your written report . 
Allow me to highlight a few . 
The issue at stake here , of course , remains the monopoly of the pharmaceutical companies , which arises partly from the long lifespan of patents . 
We are precluding research by small undertakings . 
Holders of licences and patents will focus their research first and foremost on areas where , for example , there are large patient groups . 
That has always been a reality which no - one , ourselves included , can ignore . 
Discoverers of genes , according to your report , should still equate to patent - holders . 
The patent - holder is given virtually exclusive rights to exploit and market the new research findings ; given the near - oligopoly that exists in this domain , there is a particular danger that the SMEs and small research units will be trampled underfoot . 
The reverse of your line of argument is true , which is why I see the Gebhardt and Berger amendments as an opportunity to redress the balance in some respects and to make the report approvable . 
Madam President , I do not think there is any doubt at all that this debate has been shrouded in misinformation and quite deliberate sensationalist claims about patenting body - parts and the like . 
We have to set that aside and look at the reality of it . 
Biotechnology is an important industry in the European Union ; it is a tremendously important sector , and we have to be very careful in the way we deal with it . 
If we were to reject this , of course , patenting would still continue . 
It would not continue in the European Union but it would continue somewhere else and we would have less control over it . 
Patents are effectively an award for taking a risk and investing in the development of new medicines , and we should reward our companies for taking such risks . 
However , it does not stop there . 
If we are to patent biotech inventions , then we must take into account ethical considerations . 
It is not enough simply to adopt what I would describe as the ' gee whiz school of technology ' . 
One has to recognize that ethical questions have to be asked and solutions must be found . 
That is why Ian White 's amendment introducing an ethical committee will give us the kind of directive that we want and need . 
We need this because there is a question , not just about the right of companies , but also about the right of patients to have their suffering from genetic diseases alleviated . 
That is tremendously important , and we must recognize that there are these ethical questions . 
It is not possible to have an ethical assessment of every patent application , because I understand that there are some 10, 000 applications every year in the European Union , and there are not that number of philosophers to go round . 
However , we need to have a framework within which such decisions can be made . 
This is the first reading , and it is important that we show the Commission , the Council and the wider public that we are quite serious about this and that we recognize the need for a directive , but one with an ethical dimension . 
That is a sine qua non of progress . 
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Parliament is about to conclude this first reading of the new proposal for a directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions : this was no easy task ! 
We all remembe. and some of you actually mentione. the vote of 1 March 1995 . 
On that occasion and , generally , throughout the whole process of considering the earlier proposal , the European Parliament had voiced its own concern about the consequences that adopting the proposal might have had and raised important issues . 
Through that vote of 1 March 1995 and despite the efforts made on all sides during the conciliation procedure , the European Parliament said one thing clearly : that it remained unpersuaded by the reasons and explanations provided . 
Straightforward ethical and political questions had not , plainly , received equally straightforward and clear answers . 
In this new proposal for a directive , the Commission , basically , set itself one principal objective : to respond to the concerns that had been expressed and to mark out those areas which had previously been insufficiently clear . 
That had , naturally , to be done within the scope of a sectoral directive on patents . 
What then is the central question ? 
To provide an absolute guarantee that the reasons behind the research , the industry and competitiveness were set within clear limits that prevent any form of appropriation of the human body , including the smallest elements thereof . 
The Amsterdam European Council also clearly affirmed in its conclusions the absolute principle of respect for the integrity of human beings . 
It is a question of establishing whether biological material can be patented . 
We need therefore to establish clearly the distinction between the discovery of something that exists in nature and an invention that is the product of human activity with a well - defined objective . 
The ethical aspect of biotechnological inventions , and particularly those concerning isolated elements of the human body , was therefore the Commission 's starting - point for a thorough review to identify the most appropriate solution in this extremely sensitive area . 
The Commission talked to the group of consultants on the ethics of biotechnology about the ethical aspects of patenting inventions involving elements of human origin . 
Its opinion was given on 25 September 1996 . 
That positive opinion confirmed the Commission in its approach and provided further pointers . 
I note , moreover , that Amendment No 1 specifically refers to this . 
During the preparatory work for this plenary sitting , no less than six committees of the European Parliament worked on the proposal for a directive and held many lengthy meetings . 
The debate was frank , open and far - reaching , and the arguments were entered into fully . 
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights was therefore in full possession of the facts when it adopted its report on 18 June last , and I should like to extend my special thanks here to the rapporteur , Mr Rothley , for his exceptional work which is much to be admired . 
I should also like to thank everyone , including those whose opinions have been less positive because this has been an important and civilized debate . 
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights adopted 64 amendments . 
The Commission is prepared to accept all of those amendments because they provide suitable clarification.. . 
... of the sensitive matters currently under discussion . 
The main points are as follows : a formula that very clearly defines the difference between discovery and invention as regards isolated elements of the human body ; nonpatentability of animal or plant species ; an explicit ban on patenting human reproductive cloning procedures and procedures for modifying the germinal genetic identity of human beings ; the need never to forget the ethical dimension and the possibility of that being the subject of appropriate preventive assessment ; the achievement of a balance between the suffering that some inventions could cause to animals and the considerable usefulness of such inventions in medicine ; and improved presentation of breeders ' privileges . 
On all of those point. as well , of course , as many other. the Commission believes that the contribution of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights has been crucial to achieving the main aim , namely striking a balance between economic requirements and the absolute need to respect ethics . 
The Commission is therefore , I repeat , prepared to accept all of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights and to incorporate them into its amended proposal . 
Some redrafting will be needed : this will not in any way change the substance of the amendments but simply improve the form to meet legal and institutional requirements . 
The Commission considers that Amendment No 1, for instance , which I have already quoted , would be better inserted into a recital . 
And as regards Amendment No 56 which calls for an ethics committee to be set up , the Commission will be referring to the group of consultants on the ethics of biotechnology which has already been set up . 
Moreover , the House recently adopted a resolution renewing the mandate of that group of consultants . 
As part of the effort to achieve a balance , the Commission is also prepared to consider a number of amendments that were tabled subsequently : Amendments Nos 67, 69, 77, 79 and 99, for example . 
The proposal , as amended , will be submitted to the Council so that it can establish its common position . 
The proposal for a directive is of crucial importance to the Council because it is one of the four initiatives under the action plan for the single market that the Member States have been called upon by the European Council to adopt as rapidly as possible and , at any event , by 1 January 1999 . 
We may therefore hope that the Luxembourg presidency , which is extremely sensitive to the problem , will be able to arrive at the common position at the meeting of the ' Internal Market ' Council on 27 November next . 
The European Parliament can count on the Commission to see that its contribution is respected and retained on that occasion . Let me thank the House on behalf of the Commission for its contribution , and add my own personal thanks . 
Thank you , Commissioner . 
I believe we have witnessed an example toda. just as we would wish to see , in fac. of excellent cooperation between the Commission and Parliament . 
It really does work ! 
I should like to express my special thanks for your contribution , Commissioner . 
Madam President , I have a question for Mr Monti on Amendment 49 .
